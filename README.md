### ‚öôÔ∏è **Technical Sync**

  ```prisma
  model Character {
    luffyProgress   Int // Unlocked Gear tiers
    zoroNavigation  Int // Islands discovered
    usoppQuests     Int // Sniper upgrades
    sanjiMeals      Int // Buffs crafted
  }

  - `ExplorationService` uses #Tierison's loyalty to calculate sailing speed.  
  - `QuestService` tracks #LYuka's questlines for progression gates.  
  - `InventoryService` lets #GarryAng convert items into buffs.

### üìú **Step-by-Step User Guide**  

1. **Start Your Journey**  
   - Use `/create-character [name]` and pick a mentor:  
     - `#YB` ‚Üí Combat focus  
     - `#Tierison` ‚Üí Exploration focus  
     - `#LYuka` ‚Üí Quest/stealth focus  
     - `#GarryAng` ‚Üí Support/economy focus

   - **Noon**: `!sail` with Zoro to new islands; use `!explore` for loot.  
   - **Night**: `!interact GarryAng` to cook stat-boosting meals.  

3. **Advanced Tactics**

### üéØ Why This Sync Works  
- **No Feature Isolation**: Quests require items from exploration, which need navigation buffs from Zoro, which depend on combat stats from Luffy.  
- **Character-Driven Progression**: Each NPC gates specific upgrades (e.g., Sanji won't cook 5-star meals unless you've helped Usopp).  
- **Community Impact**: Server-wide "Yonko Wars" events let alliances (#YB crew vs #GarryAng crew) battle for territory control.
